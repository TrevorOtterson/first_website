# personal_bio_webpage
This is my very first website using bootstrap, css, and html.

For this project I used bootstrap inside my html file in order to add style and make a responsive website.
This was my first website from scratch so I ran into many struggles.
I was able to create opperational links that changes colors when hovered over, clicked on, and when the page was active.
I was able to add a container to each page with a working footer and header that was responsive with smaller and larger window sizes.

One of the biggest struggels with this project was figuring out the correct css code in order to make it look good, and format correctly.
Very excited to keep improving this page and adding more about me to it.
